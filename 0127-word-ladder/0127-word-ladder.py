        Understand:

        beginWord to endWord using wordList. 

        adjancent pair of words -> in sequence differ by single letter. 
        0 if no sequence exists. 

        Questions:
        endWord needs to be in wordList?
        all words length -> same
        words are unique. 

        return: number of words in sequence. 

        Match:
        Graph BFS

        But how to find neighbors. 

        Create an intermediate words from substituting each letter from words in the wordList with *. 

        Store these intermediate words as key and all the words, that can form this intermediate word will be the values. 

        Now, in bfs, when we need to find neighbors. we create intermediate words of the current word. And then get the neighbors of that intermediate word (values) from the hash.
